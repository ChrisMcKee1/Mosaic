## Navigation

Each document is self-contained but references related documents where appropriate. Start with `system-overview.md` for the big picture, then drill down into specific functional areas as needed.

## Mermaid Diagrams

All diagrams are tested for Mermaid syntax compatibility and should render correctly in VS Code, GitHub, and other Mermaid-compatible viewers.
