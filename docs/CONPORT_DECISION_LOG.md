# Conport Decision Log - IngestionPlugin Implementation

## Decision Entry: Technology Research Validation

**Date**: July 21, 2025  
**Decision ID**: INGEST-TECH-001  
**Status**: Research Complete - Ready for Implementation  
**Impact**: High - Enables core code ingestion functionality

### Decision Summary
Completed comprehensive research validation of core technologies required for IngestionPlugin implementation. All technologies are mature, well-supported, and align with Mosaic's Azure-native architecture requirements.

### Research Findings

#### Technology Validation Results
1. **GitPython 2025**: ✅ Validated - v3.1.43+ supports all required features
2. **Tree-sitter Python**: ✅ Validated - Multi-language AST parsing operational  
3. **Azure OpenAI Embeddings**: ✅ Validated - text-embedding-3-small API patterns confirmed
4. **Cosmos DB Vector Search**: ✅ Validated - NoSQL vector search GA and production-ready
5. **OmniRAG Pattern**: ✅ Validated - Unified backend approach feasible

#### Key Technical Decisions
- **Authentication**: Token-based Git auth with environment variables
- **Parsing Strategy**: Tree-sitter primary, regex fallback for unsupported languages
- **Embedding Model**: text-embedding-3-small (1536 dimensions, cost-optimized)
- **Storage Pattern**: OmniRAG unified documents in Cosmos DB NoSQL
- **Error Handling**: Multi-layer resilience with graceful degradation

### Implementation Readiness
- All required libraries available and compatible
- Azure services configured and accessible
- Security patterns validated and documented
- Performance optimization strategies identified

### Next Actions
- Proceed with implementation of 4 missing IngestionPlugin methods
- Follow phased approach: Repository → AST → Embeddings → Storage
- Implement comprehensive testing strategy
- Maintain alignment with FR-2 (Semantic Kernel) and FR-4 (Azure Native)

## Task Entry: IngestionPlugin Implementation

**Date**: July 21, 2025  
**Task ID**: INGEST-IMPL-001  
**Priority**: High  
**Assigned To**: Development Team  
**Estimated Effort**: 4 weeks

### Task Description
Implement the 4 missing methods in IngestionPlugin to enable complete code repository ingestion functionality within the Mosaic MCP Tool architecture.

### Required Methods Implementation
1. `clone_repository(repo_url, local_path, auth_token)` - GitPython integration
2. `analyze_code_structure(file_path)` - Tree-sitter AST parsing  
3. `generate_embeddings(text_chunks)` - Azure OpenAI embeddings
4. `store_in_cosmos(documents)` - Cosmos DB NoSQL storage with vector search

### Technical Requirements
- **Framework**: Semantic Kernel Plugin architecture (FR-2 compliance)
- **Platform**: Azure-native deployment (FR-4 compliance)  
- **Protocol**: MCP-compliant tool exposure (FR-1 compliance)
- **Pattern**: OmniRAG unified backend (unified Cosmos DB)
- **Security**: OAuth 2.1 authentication, managed identity, secure token handling

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Repository Management (Week 1)
- GitPython integration with secure authentication
- Error handling for network, auth, and disk space issues
- Shallow cloning optimization for performance
- Testing with public and private repositories

#### Phase 2: Code Analysis (Week 2)  
- Tree-sitter parser setup for multiple languages
- AST traversal for functions, classes, imports, dependencies
- Language detection and fallback mechanisms
- Syntax error resilience and graceful degradation

#### Phase 3: Embedding Generation (Week 3)
- Azure OpenAI text-embedding-3-small integration
- Batch processing with rate limiting
- Text preprocessing and chunking optimization
- Error recovery and retry mechanisms

#### Phase 4: Cosmos DB Storage (Week 4)
- OmniRAG document schema implementation
- Vector indexing configuration and optimization
- Bulk operations and transaction handling
- Performance tuning and monitoring

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All 4 methods implemented and unit tested
- [ ] Integration tests pass with real Azure services
- [ ] Performance validated with 1000+ file repositories
- [ ] Security audit passed with no critical findings
- [ ] MCP protocol compliance verified
- [ ] Documentation complete and reviewed

### Risk Mitigation
- **Technology Risk**: Validated through comprehensive research
- **Performance Risk**: Implement batching, caching, and optimization patterns
- **Security Risk**: Use Azure managed identity and secure coding practices
- **Integration Risk**: Continuous testing with existing Semantic Kernel plugins

### Dependencies
- Azure OpenAI Service deployment and configuration
- Cosmos DB for NoSQL with vector search enabled
- Authentication tokens for repository access
- Tree-sitter language parsers compiled and available

### Deliverables
1. Complete IngestionPlugin implementation with 4 methods
2. Comprehensive test suite (unit + integration)
3. Performance benchmarks and optimization recommendations
4. Security validation and audit results
5. Integration documentation and examples
6. Deployment and monitoring configuration

### Notes
This implementation directly supports the core value proposition of Mosaic: solving "Context is More Than a Prompt" through sophisticated multi-source retrieval and "Dependency Blindness" through graph-based code analysis.
