## Usage Patterns

### Basic Query Examples

#### 1. Relationship and Dependency Queries (GRAPH_RAG)

```python
# Natural language queries that trigger graph-based retrieval
queries = [
    "Show me all functions that depend on the authentication module",
    "What classes inherit from BaseModel and their properties?",
    "Find circular dependencies in the import structure",
    "Display the complete call chain from API endpoints to database operations"
]

# These automatically route to graph-based SPARQL queries
for query in queries:
    result = await omnirag.process_query(query, user_context)
    # Returns: Graph relationships, dependency trees, call chains
```

#### 2. Semantic Content Search (VECTOR_RAG)

```python
# Queries focused on semantic similarity and content matching
queries = [
    "Find functions that handle user authentication and session management",
    "How to implement error handling best practices in async functions?",
    "Locate code examples for database connection patterns",
    "Show documentation about API rate limiting strategies"
]

# These route to vector-based semantic search
for query in queries:
    result = await omnirag.process_query(query, user_context)
    # Returns: Semantically similar functions, documentation, examples
```

#### 3. Structured Data Queries (DATABASE_RAG)

```python
# Queries requiring structured data access and filtering
queries = [
    "List all functions with more than 50 lines that have no docstrings",
    "Find classes created in the last month with specific patterns",
    "Show statistics on code complexity across different modules",
    "Get all API endpoints that don't have rate limiting"
]

# These route to database-style structured queries
for query in queries:
    result = await omnirag.process_query(query, user_context)
    # Returns: Filtered datasets, statistics, structured information
```

#### 4. Complex Multi-Strategy Queries (HYBRID)

```python
# Complex queries requiring multiple retrieval strategies
queries = [
    "Find authentication functions, show their dependencies, and provide usage examples",
    "Analyze error handling patterns across all modules and suggest improvements",
    "Review security implementation and identify potential vulnerabilities",
    "Comprehensive analysis of the codebase architecture with recommendations"
]

# These use multiple strategies in parallel/sequence
for query in queries:
    result = await omnirag.process_query(query, user_context)
    # Returns: Multi-faceted analysis combining graph, vector, and database results
```

### Advanced Integration Patterns

#### 1. Session-Aware Queries

```python
# OmniRAG automatically maintains user sessions and learns preferences
user_context = {
    "user_id": "developer_123",
    "domain": "security",
    "complexity_preference": "detailed"
}

# First interaction - system starts learning
result1 = await omnirag.process_query(
    "Show me authentication patterns",
    user_context
)

# Follow-up queries automatically adapt to learned preferences
result2 = await omnirag.process_query(
    "How about authorization patterns?",
    user_context
)
# System remembers user prefers detailed security analysis
```

#### 2. Context-Aware Orchestration

```python
# Different contexts influence strategy selection and result formatting
contexts = [
    {"domain": "performance", "urgency": "high"},
    {"domain": "security", "detail_level": "comprehensive"},
    {"domain": "documentation", "format": "tutorial"},
    {"domain": "debugging", "scope": "specific_error"}
]

query = "How to optimize database connections?"

for context in contexts:
    result = await omnirag.process_query(query, context)
    # Each result optimized for the specific context and domain
```

#### 3. Progressive Learning Integration

```python
# Learning happens automatically, but you can track improvements
async def track_query_improvements():
    base_query = "Explain the authentication system"
    user_context = {"user_id": "learning_user"}

    # Initial query
    result1 = await omnirag.process_query(base_query, user_context)

    # Simulate user interaction and feedback
    await simulate_user_engagement(result1, engagement_time=45.0)

    # Same query later - should be improved based on learning
    result2 = await omnirag.process_query(base_query, user_context)

    # Compare results - result2 should be enhanced based on learned preferences
    improvement_score = calculate_improvement(result1, result2)
    return improvement_score
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Slow Query Performance

```python
# Check system diagnostics
diagnostics = await omnirag_diagnostics()

if diagnostics["performance"]["avg_response_time"] > 2.0:
    # Possible solutions:
    # 1. Enable query caching
    # 2. Optimize vector index
    # 3. Tune aggregation parameters
    # 4. Check system resources
```

#### 2. Poor Intent Detection

```python
# Check intent classification accuracy
intent_stats = await classify_query_intent("test query")

if intent_stats["confidence"] < 0.7:
    # Possible solutions:
    # 1. Retrain intent classification model
    # 2. Add more training examples
    # 3. Adjust confidence thresholds
    # 4. Use HYBRID strategy as fallback
```

#### 3. Learning System Issues

```python
# Check learning system status
learning_status = await learning_diagnostics()

if not learning_status["learning_enabled"]:
    # Possible solutions:
    # 1. Check Redis connectivity
    # 2. Verify Azure credentials
    # 3. Restart learning middleware
    # 4. Check session storage
```

### Monitoring and Alerting

#### 1. Performance Monitoring

```python
# Set up performance monitoring
async def monitor_omnirag_performance():
    metrics = await performance_metrics()

    # Alert thresholds
    if metrics["avg_response_time"] > 2.5:
        send_alert("OmniRAG response time exceeding threshold")

    if metrics["error_rate"] > 0.05:
        send_alert("OmniRAG error rate too high")

    if metrics["memory_usage_mb"] > 1000:
        send_alert("OmniRAG memory usage high")
```

#### 2. Quality Monitoring

```python
# Monitor query quality and user satisfaction
async def monitor_query_quality():
    diagnostics = await omnirag_diagnostics()

    # Quality metrics
    intent_accuracy = diagnostics["intent_accuracy"]
    response_quality = diagnostics["avg_response_quality"]

    if intent_accuracy < 0.8:
        send_alert("Intent detection accuracy below threshold")

    if response_quality < 0.7:
        send_alert("Response quality degraded")
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Query Formulation

- **Be specific**: Detailed queries get better intent detection
- **Use domain context**: Include relevant context for better results
- **Iterate naturally**: Follow-up questions work better with session learning

### 2. Context Management

- **Consistent user IDs**: Enable proper session tracking
- **Rich context**: Include domain, complexity, and format preferences
- **Session continuity**: Maintain context across related queries

### 3. Performance Optimization

- **Batch similar queries**: Group related queries for efficiency
- **Use appropriate complexity**: Don't over-specify simple queries
- **Monitor and tune**: Regular performance monitoring and optimization

### 4. Integration Patterns

- **Async throughout**: Use async/await patterns consistently
- **Error handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling
- **Graceful degradation**: Design fallbacks for component failures

## Migration from Basic RAG

### Backward Compatibility

OmniRAG maintains full backward compatibility with existing Basic RAG implementations:

```python
# Existing Basic RAG code continues to work
result = await basic_rag_query("find authentication functions")

# OmniRAG enhancement is automatic and transparent
# Same interface, enhanced capabilities
```

### Gradual Migration Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Deploy OmniRAG alongside Basic RAG
2. **Phase 2**: Route complex queries to OmniRAG
3. **Phase 3**: Enable learning for all queries
4. **Phase 4**: Full OmniRAG deployment

### Feature Flag Support

```python
# Control OmniRAG features with flags
settings = {
    "enable_intent_detection": True,
    "enable_multi_strategy": True,
    "enable_learning": True,
    "fallback_to_basic_rag": True
}

# Gradual rollout with feature flags
omnirag = OmniRAGOrchestrator(settings)
```

## Conclusion

The complete OmniRAG integration transforms the Mosaic MCP Tool from a Basic RAG system into an intelligent, adaptive, multi-source orchestration platform. With automatic intent detection, intelligent context aggregation, and invisible learning capabilities, OmniRAG provides significantly enhanced query processing while maintaining complete backward compatibility.
