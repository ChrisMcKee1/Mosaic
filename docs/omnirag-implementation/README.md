# OmniRAG Implementation for Mosaic MCP Tool

## 📋 Overview

This documentation folder contains the complete implementation guide for transforming the Mosaic MCP Tool from basic RAG to the advanced OmniRAG pattern, following the CosmosAIGraph reference architecture.

## 🎯 Transformation Goal

**From**: Basic Vector RAG → Simple context retrieval → LLM response
**To**: OmniRAG → Intelligent intent detection → Multi-source orchestration (Graph + Vector + Database) → Enhanced context → LLM response

## ⚡ Quick Start Checklist

Before beginning implementation:

- [ ] Read `01-current-state-analysis.md` to understand what's broken
- [ ] Review `02-architecture-transformation.md` for the target state
- [ ] Study the research links in `04-research-references.md`
- [ ] Choose your starting phase from `03-implementation-phases/`

## 🚨 Critical Success Factors

1. **Don't skip research phases** - Each implementation step requires specific research
2. **Follow the exact order** - Dependencies between phases are critical
3. **Test incrementally** - Each phase must be validated before proceeding
4. **Preserve existing functionality** - Maintain backward compatibility during transition

## 📅 Estimated Timeline

- **Phase 1 (RDF Infrastructure)**: 4-6 weeks
- **Phase 2 (SPARQL Integration)**: 3-4 weeks  
- **Phase 3 (OmniRAG Orchestration)**: 4-6 weeks
- **Testing & Deployment**: 2-3 weeks
- **Total**: 13-19 weeks

## 🔄 Return-from-Break Protocol

If returning after extended absence:

1. Re-read this README
2. Review the current state analysis
3. Check which phase was last completed
4. Re-research the specific links for your next phase
5. Run existing tests to verify current functionality
6. Proceed with implementation
