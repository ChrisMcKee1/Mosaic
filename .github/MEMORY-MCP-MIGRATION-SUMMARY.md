### 3. Advanced Workflow Patterns

#### Multi-Entity Creation

Commands now create coordinated entities with comprehensive relationship networks:

```typescript
// Create task with full context
await create_entities([task, guide, success_criteria]);
await create_relations([
  { from: guide, to: task, relationType: "guides" },
  { from: success_criteria, to: task, relationType: "defines_success_for" },
]);
```

#### Session-Aware Context

Development sessions track active work and provide continuity:

```typescript
// Link all work to current session
await create_relations([
  { from: current_session, to: active_task, relationType: "focuses_on" },
]);
```

#### Knowledge Discovery

Commands leverage historical knowledge through intelligent search:

```typescript
// Find related patterns and decisions
await search_nodes(`entityType:pattern AND (${keywords.join(" OR ")})`);
```
