# GitHub Issue Workflow

Comprehensive GitHub issue management workflow for bugs, features, and enhancements.

## Usage
`/github-issue-workflow <issue title>`

## Arguments
- `$ARGUMENTS`: The GitHub issue title (required)

## Chained Workflow Steps

### 1. Issue Analysis with Sequential Thinking
```
Use mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking to:
- Analyze the issue type (bug, feature, enhancement)
- Identify related functional requirements
- Plan issue description and acceptance criteria
- Consider priority and impact assessment
```

### 2. ConPort Context Research
```
Use mcp__conport__search_decisions_fts to find related decisions
Use mcp__conport__search_custom_data_value_fts to find relevant context
Use mcp__conport__get_progress to check related work
Use mcp__conport__get_linked_items to understand dependencies
```

### 3. GitHub CLI Issue Creation
```
Use mcp__desktop-commander__execute_command for:
- gh issue create --title "$ARGUMENTS" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Description
[Auto-generated from ConPort context and analysis]

## Functional Requirements
[Related FR-X requirements]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Specific, testable criteria
- [ ] Performance requirements if applicable
- [ ] Integration requirements

## Technical Notes
[Implementation considerations from ConPort]

## Related Work

```

### 4. Issue Documentation and Tracking
```
Use mcp__conport__log_progress for issue tracking:
- Status: "TODO"
- Description: "GitHub Issue: $ARGUMENTS"
- Link to functional requirements if applicable

Use mcp__conport__log_custom_data for issue details:
- Category: "GitHubIssues"
- Key: issue number
- Value: issue details, priority, related context
```

### 5. Research and Validation
```
Use mcp__context7__resolve-library-id for relevant documentation
Use mcp__context7__get-library-docs for technical requirements
Use WebSearch to validate:
- Similar issues in the community
- Current best practices
- Known solutions or workarounds
```

### 6. Implementation Planning
```
Use mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking to:
- Break down issue into implementation tasks
- Estimate effort and complexity
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Plan testing approach
```

### 7. Enhanced Issue Body Generation
```
Auto-generate comprehensive issue description including:
- Problem statement with context
- Functional requirements mapping
- Technical implementation notes
- Acceptance criteria with test cases
- Related ConPort decisions and patterns
```

### 8. Issue Linking and Prioritization
```
Use mcp__conport__link_conport_items to connect:
- Issue to functional requirements
- Issue to related decisions
- Issue to system patterns
- Issue to existing progress items

Use mcp__desktop-commander__execute_command for:
- gh issue edit [issue-number] --add-label "priority-[high/medium/low]"
- gh issue edit [issue-number] --add-assignee @me (if working on it)
```
